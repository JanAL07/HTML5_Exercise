        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A simple yet complex hobby of mine is drawing. I like to sketch figures because they give me joy when I finish them.
            Drawing people and sometimes backgrounds also strengthen my brain. I see references everywhere and I study art more easily because of that.
            Characters that are my favorite to draw include Silent Salt Cookie, White Lily Cookie, and Elder Faerie Cookie.

        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>I like this hobby of mine because it's fun. It doesn't require you to be perfect, and that's fine. I like it that way. 
            After all, drawing is all about putting your heart, soul, mind, spirit and passion in your art.
            I started drawing since I was a little kid. I remember thinking I was the best artist on grade 3 as I thought I could draw slightly better than the rest.
            I did end up retiring on drawing for a few years before I started once more in mid to late grade 6.</p>
